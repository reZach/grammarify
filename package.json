Examples of safe cleaning include capitalizing the beginning of sentences, spellchecking mispelled words, changing SMS-speak to full words, fixed stretched words (ie. 'borrreedd'), removing lexical illusions (ie. multiple 'the the dog') and combining words that are mistaken separated (ie. 'her self' to 'herself').",
